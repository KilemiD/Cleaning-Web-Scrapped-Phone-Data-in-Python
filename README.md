# Cleaning-Web-Scrapped-Phone-Data-in-Python
If you have scrapped unstructured text data in Python using Beautiful Soup, how do you clean it? This phone data has been obtained from this link https://www.jumia.co.ke/smartphones/?shipped_from=country_local&page=1.
I have gone ahead and obtained Phone RAM, ROM, Battery Size, Screen Size, Brand Name, cleaned the data and made visualization. 
Here you will find two notebooks that generated the data and the one used for cleaning.
